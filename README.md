# ChooseViz

ChooseViz is the source repository for the web app Vizzard. Vizzard is designed to help researchers plot their data in a clear and reproducible way. It was initiated as part of the Software Sustainability Institute Collaboration Workshop 2018's Hackday.

# Why is Vizzard useful?

Vizzard aims to bridge the gap from naive, widely-used plotting tools towards reproducible scientific plot generation by providing users with justified suggestions about how to plot their data and example plotting scripts.

# Future potential

Add-ons to Vizzard may include the possibility to upload your own data (currently an example data set is used) or expand the number of scripting languages available (currently just matplotlib). More details can be found in this repository's issues
