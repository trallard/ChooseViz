A stacked bar chart is a way of representing the frequencies of a categorical variable. The heights of the bar corresponds to the frequency. Stacked bar charts may offer and advantage over traditional bar charts as it is easier to visualise proportions of the whole. However they may offer disadvantages also, as it is more difficult to compare the heights of bars whose bottoms begin in different places.
