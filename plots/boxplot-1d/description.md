A boxplot, or a box-and-whisker plot, is a visual representation of a set of summary statistics, summarising the distribution and spread of quantative data. The extremities of the box itself represents the first and third quartiles of the data, and a bisecting line represents the median. The whiskers then represent other measures of spread, usually the values at 1.5 times the inter quartile range. Outliers, those that lie outside the range of the whiskers, are also represented.
