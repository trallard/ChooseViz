Vizzard is aimed at giving you a _justified_ _suggestion_ as to what kind of plot may be appropriate for your purposes and helping you make your plots more reproducible. Vizzard does not in any way preclude you from doing a thorough analysis - you should think about your data critically and independently. Vizzard is distributed under a TODO licence.
