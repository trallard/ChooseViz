# How is Vizzard different from its alternatives?

Visualization is a key part of science communication, and needs to be done in an effective, appropriate and reproducible way (1,2). Many data visualization tools exist, but Vizzard is unique in that it tries to educate and push towards reproducibility at the same time. This text explores some of the differences between existing visualization tools and Vizzard.

## Visual Vocab

[Visual Vocabulary](http://ft-interactive.github.io/visual-vocabulary/) is a resource describing many visualization methods categorized by the sort of data relationship they emphasize. The main differences to Vizzard are:
1. Vizzard tailors the proposed visualization methods to the individual user's data
2. Vizzard provides a code template to encourage reproducible data visualization
3. Vizzard is designed to be educational

## Python and R Graph Galleries

The [Python Graph Gallery](https://python-graph-gallery.com/) and the [R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/) exemplify possible ways of visualizing data using a scripting language, but do not relate to the user's data.
