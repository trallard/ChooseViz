# Why Vizzard?
Reproducibility is a key aspect of good Science. Established plotting tools such as Excel or SPSS rely on not necessarily repeatable user input (lots of clicks!). Using scripting languages such as [R](https://www.rdocumentation.org/) or [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/index.html) requires a higher level of coding skills and plenty of time to read a convoluted documentation, but providing such scripts can enhance reproducibility. Vizzard aims to provide a well-explained pathway to navigate from naive, widely-used plotting tools towards more reproducible plotting tools.
