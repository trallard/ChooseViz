# Why Vizzard?
Reproducibility is a key aspect of good Science. Established plotting tools such as Excel or SPSS rely on not necessarily repeatable user input (lots of clicks!). Using scripting languages such as R or Matplotlib requires a higher level of coding skills and plenty of time to read a convoluted documentation, but providing such scripts can enhance reproducibility. Vizzard aims to provide a well-explained pathway to navigate from naive, widely-used plotting tools towards more reproducible plTotting tools.

TODO: add hyperlinks to R and Matplotlib websites.
